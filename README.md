# memory
Memory game with javascript, php and mysql over linux.
This project is based on a Memory Game from Nat Wiley I found at codepen.io, thank you for sharing.
The idea is to store information about mouse clicks, time played etc in a db and evaluate it via reporting.
Feel free to play a game on www.strudelbaum.com\memory.php and check the report on www.strudelbaum.com\mrep.php.
(Tested on Chrome, still some visualisation problems on firefox).
